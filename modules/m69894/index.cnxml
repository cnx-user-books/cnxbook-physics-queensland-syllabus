    <caption>The motion of this Eclipse Concept jet can be described in terms of the distance it has traveled (a scalar quantity) or its displacement in a specific direction (a vector quantity). In order to specify the direction of motion, its displacement must be described based on a coordinate system. In this case, it may be convenient to choose motion toward the left as positive motion (it is the forward direction for the plane), although in many cases, the <m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>x</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{x} {}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>-coordinate runs from left to right, with motion to the right as positive and motion to the left as negative.

For example, a <m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>20ºC</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:semantics></m:math> temperature, the 250 kilocalories (250 Calories) of energy in a candy bar, a 90 km/h speed limit, a person’s 1.8 m height, and a distance of 2.0 m are all scalars—quantities with no specified direction. Note, however, that a scalar can be negative, such as a <m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">−</m:mo><m:mtext>20ºC</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:semantics></m:math> temperature.

<title>Coordinate Systems for One-Dimensional Motion</title>

    <para id="import-auto-id1789071">In order to describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must designate a coordinate system within the reference frame. For one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting of a one-dimensional coordinate line. In general, when describing horizontal motion, motion to the right is usually considered positive, and motion to the left is considered negative. With vertical motion, motion up is usually positive and motion down is negative. In some cases, however, as with the jet in <link target-id="import-auto-id1778274"/>, it can be more convenient to switch the positive and negative directions. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be useful to define downwards as the positive direction. If people in a race are running to the left, it is useful to define left as the positive direction. It does not matter as long as the system is clear and consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving a problem, you cannot change it.</para><figure xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="import-auto-id1758074"><media id="import-auto-id1760648" alt="An x y coordinate system.
